```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
git2r::add(path = "*")
git2r::commit(message = "need to commit before rendering")
```


#### Context

Here we employ **usethis** functions to modify a pull request locally. Without these functions, the process is *much more complicated and error prone*. Note that the preferred workflow is to ask the person who submitted the changes to make the modifications that you request. You would only do this editing yourself, following the steps below, in a situation in which the contributor is not responding, or does not have the skills to make the changes you need. It will only work if the
“Allow edits from maintainers” box is checked when the pull request is
made. This is the default and is yet another reason why pull requests are
most natural from a non-`master` branch.

#### Install **usethis**

Use the dev version:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## not run
devtools::install_github("r-lib/usethis")
```

#### Open local version of repo

Open the local project for the repo and pull changes, either by clicking on the PULL button in RStudio or as follows:

```{r}
git2r::pull()
```

#### Find and fetch the pull request

Look for the pull request number in the [list of pull requests](https://github.com/jtr13/usethis_demos/pulls). We see that the [pull request we want](https://github.com/jtr13/usethis_demos/pull/1) is number 1.

```{r}
usethis::pr_fetch(1)
```

#### Fix the PR

You are now on the PR branch:

```{bash}
git status
```

Make changes as desired, then save and commit them.

Now we're ready for [Part 2](how_to2.md).
